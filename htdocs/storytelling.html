	      <h3>Introduction</h3>
	      <p>The Good Place has such a unique and efficient way in telling its story. Through the use of many techniques, the show is able to evoke all kinds of emotions from the viewer. You’ll feel a sense of surprise, shock, sadness, and even, calmness. In the end, the finale is satisfying and “right”—it ties up the plot in with a proper ending.</p>

	        <h3>Twists and Turns</h3>
	        <p>Like any good story, the show completely beats your expectations and presents shocking twists. Being a story concerning the afterlife—something beyond the human laws of time and space—it has limitless possibilities and concepts to explore (which it does). This suspense and excitement keep you at the edge of your seat, waiting for everything to eventually play its part. For instance, we get the big reveal of the seemingly Good Place being the Bad Place, Michael teaming up with the humans, humanity about to be rebooted, and so much more. Even the ending where the characters chose to go through the Last Door is surprising all on its own.</p>
	        <h3>Just Right</h3>
	        <p>Since the show only had four seasons, the writers were able to plan its story ahead and pace it accordingly. In that way, we were able to say a proper goodbye to the characters and give them the sendoff they deserved. The plot then didn't feel rushed or abrupt. A significant factor in making this flow of the story so effective was a different conflict for each season. As the show progresses, it becomes something bigger than the characters we started with—fixing the system. At the end, when all the external conflicts have been solved, we are only left with the characters' final journey to solve their internal conflicts in their final "death."</p>
	        <h3>The End</h3>
	        <p>The end of the story is simply put, genius and extraordinary. Usually, endings don't feel "right"—sometimes, shows throw away everything the previous seasons built, or sometimes, they feel incomplete. However, the Good Place wrapped up the show in such a beautiful way. And so, even when you feel down that this story has ended and these characters have literally ceased to exist, you still feel a sense of completeness, calmness, and satisfaction because it is the fitting ending. Eventually, there must be an end; further stretching the show  even more would make it dull and repetitive. Thus, the finale leaves such a strong emotional impact to the viewers because there is a definite end to the story.</p>
