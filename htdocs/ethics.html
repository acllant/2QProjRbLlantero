	      <h3>Introduction</h3>
	      <p>For a comedy show, one would not expect the Good Place to ultimately be about philosophy. Ethics and philosophy lessons are not only used as tools to progress the plot but also incorporated into the story. Ostensibly, it is only about the afterlife of our protagonists, but beneath the surface it is something much deeper. It explores multiple concepts and philosophical problems about human nature, existence, and the value of morality in such a profound way.</p>

	        <h3>A Journey to be Good</h3>
	        <p>Chidi Anagonye, a moral philosophy professor, initially guides Eleanor and Jason to be ethical people, earning their place in heaven. Eventually, he teaches the entire team, along with Michael, essential lessons on ethics and philosophy. While we watch these characters learning about notable quotes and philosophers, we, too, learn what it means to be "good" and the many conflicting concepts that come with it. We learn valuable lessons, which we see are played out by the characters. For instance, there are thought experiments, thought-provoking questions, and several moral dilemmas. We witness their growth through their actions, and in a way, we grow with them too.</p>
	        <h3>The Point System</h3>
	        <p>The good and bad place system is essentially based upon a point system that quantifies any action everyone does, varying on the level of its goodness or badness. "Good" actions are given positive points, while "bad" actions are given negative points. This measure of morality inherently comes with the questions on what makes these things good or bad and what constitutes those points. We see these answered on the protagonists’ journey in unveiling the defects of the system and its unfairness. The show presents the ramifications of things like doing good simply for the sake of points, the discrimination and inequality the system poses, and so much more.</p>
	        <h3>The Show's Philosophy</h3>
	        <p>In the end, we see that the show's philosophy on goodness is to do good for ourselves and others—give "what we owe to each other." This book, What We Owe to Each Other, is referenced a lot of times throughout the seasons, and it greatly encapsulates what the show is trying to get across. In the end, the team succeeds in creating an effective system that truly brings out the good in all people. Another theme consistent in the show is that people can change. For instance, when Eleanor returned back to Earth in Season 2, we see that she acted more morally despite losing her memories. Moreover, Michael, the literal demon, changes into a thoughtful and decent person.</p>
