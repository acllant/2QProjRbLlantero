	      <h3>Introduction</h3>
	      <p>The Good Place is genuinely unlike any other comedy show—its humor is refreshing, original, and incredibly witty. Its jokes are so effective and compelling because they are new, relatable for all audiences, and of course, perfect for quoting.</p>

	        <h3>Originality</h3>
	        <p>Unlike most shows being produced nowadays, the show's banter doesn't rely on poking fun at people and involving racist or sexist remarks. It's also exhilarating to hear a truly hilarious joke that is not a cliché—a funny joke that is funny on its own. One can also see the creativity, imagination, and brilliance of the writers in how they explore comedy in various scopes, may it be in demons torturing humans, restaurant name puns, the censored cursing, name dropping, and even anthropomorphized vessels of knowledge.</p>
	        <h3>Relatability</h3>
	        <p>The lines and allusions mentioned in this show cater not only to Gen Z, especially with the modern references, but also to Millenials and the older generations. Take the main characters, for instance—they joke about their jobs or lives as adults. Michael, the demon, also gets to live as a human, where the show exemplifies how it's not too late to learn new things and make laughable mistakes. Even if you're an immortal being, there are relatable characters for you! The cast is also very diverse, which makes it refreshing to have someone to relate to and laugh our similar problems with. </p>
	        <h3>Shareability</h3>
	        <p>This show employs multiple witty one-liners that are perfect for quoting in real life or social media and turning into memes. Some favorites include: "Pobody's nerfect," "Ya basic!" "I am absolutely paralyzed by decision-making," "I'm going to...start crying," "If you're a devil, how come you're not wearing Prada?" "I'm too young to die and too old to eat off the kids' menu. What a stupid age I am!" "Everyone here thinks I'm Taiwanese. I'm Filipino. That's racist. Heaven is so racist," and "Apples, you eat their clothes, but oranges, you don't?"</p>
